# Password Hashing & Verification Script

This project demonstrates how to securely hash and verify passwords in Python using the built-in [`hashlib`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html) module and random salts.

It's a simple example to help understand how password hashing works and whyit's safer than storing plain-text passwords.
